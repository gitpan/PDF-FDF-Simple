	* 0.07

	* Test::Distribution and Test::Pod::Coverage only used if
	explicitely required, because I don't want to fail remote
	installation due to those modules, which might change in future.

	* 0.06

	* The Parser now also works without initial version header in FDF
	file. This is needed in FDFs that were submitted from Acrobat to
	an URL (e.g., a CGI script). Spotted by Christopher P Crawford.

	* undefined values are converted into empty strings ('') when fdf
	is generated (and/or saved), to avoid "uninitialized value"
	warnings. To avoid this, set option "skip_undefined_fields" to a
	true value (default is false); then fields whose value is
	undefined are skipped.

	* Test framework now uses Test::More (plus Test::Pod::Coverage and
	Test::Distribution if available).

	* More speed changes

	* Version 0.05, because of wrong place of 0.04-files in my CPAN dir

2004-10-21  Steffen Schwigon  <schwigon@webit.de>

	* speedup grammar by about 45%

	* attribute_file() and attribute_id() for getting/setting
	the /F and /ID attributes as suggested by David Thomas.

	* parser extension that reflects those attributes

	* tests

	* parsing of content in blocks of "non-problematic" characters.
	This gives less "Deep recursion" warnings.
