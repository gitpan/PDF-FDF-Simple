=head1 NAME

PDF::FDF::Simple - Read and write (Acrobat) FDF files.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $fdf = new PDF::FDF::Simple ({ filename     => '/tmp/test.fdf' });
  $fdf->{content} = {
                     'name'                 => 'Fred Madison',
                     'organisation'         => 'Luna Lounge Ltd.',
                     'dotted.field.name'    => 'Hello world.',
                     'language.radio.value' => 'French',
                     'my.checkbox.value'    => 'On'   # 'On' / 'Off'
                   };
  $fdf->save or print $fdf->errmsg;
  my $fdfcontent = $fdf->load;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Helps creating and extracting the content of FDF files. It is meant to
be a simple replacement for the Adobe FdfToolkit. Therefore some of
it's behavior, especially handling of diverse whitespace/newline
artefacts is orientated on FdfToolkit's handling.

After the extraction process the content is available within a hash
reference.

For creating FDF files it currently only supports setting text
values. Anyway, this should be enough to create FDF files with text
fields, text areas, checkboxes and radio buttons.

PDF::FDF::Simple uses Parse::RecDescent and understands both, the
"Kids" notation and the "dotted" notation for field names. Saving will
always use the "dotted"- notation.

=head2 Text fields / Text areas

Text fields and text areas are simply filled with the given text.

=head2 Radio button groups

In a radio button group the entry that matches exactly the field
value is selected. The entries and their values are defined in the
PDF where the FDF is loaded into.

=head2 Checkboxes

In the PDF document into which the FDF is loaded a checkbox field is
set to checked/unchecked with field values 'On' or 'Off', respectively.

=head1 API Methods

=head2 new

Constructor. Takes a hash reference for arguments.

=head2 filename

Get/set target filename (string).

=head2 content

Get/set content of fields (hashref).

=head2 load

Load an existing FDF file named via C<filename> and stores the
information in a hashref (see also C<content>).

=head2 save

Save the FDF content into the file named via C<filename>.

=head2 errmsg

Get/set error message.
Will be set internally when an error occured. Setting it is useless.

=head1 Internal Methods

Those methods are used internally and can be overwritten in derived
classes. You shouldn't use them directly.

=head2 _pre_init

Overwritable method for setting default values for initialization
before overtaking constructor params.

=head2 _post_init

Overwritable method for setting default values for initialization
after overtaking constructor params and building Parse::RecDescent
grammar.

=head2 init

Takes over the values from the given constructor hash.

=head2 _fdf_header

Returns a string which will be written before all field data.

=head2 _fdf_footer

Returns a string which will be written after all field data.

=head2 _quote

Does all quoting for field value strings.

=head2 _fdf_field_formatstr

Returns a format string for use in sprintf that creates key/value
pairs.

=head2 _map_parser_output

Puts the Parse::RecDescent output from a nested hash into a simple
hash and returns its reference.

=head1 A COMMENT ABOUT PARSING

For whose who are interested, the grammar doesn't implement a fully
PDF or FDF specification (FDF is just a subset of PDF). The approach
is rather pragmatic. It only searches for /Fields and tries to ignore
the surrounding rest. This "works for me" (TM) but it doesn't
guarantee that all possible FDFs can be parsed. If you have a strange
FDF that cannot be parsed please send it to me with the expected
content description or extend the parser by yourself and send me a
patch.
